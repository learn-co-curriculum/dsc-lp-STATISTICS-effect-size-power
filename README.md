#### Lesson Summary:
builds upon students knowledge of conditional probability and covers Bayes theorem as well as the naive Bayes algorithm. 

#### Topic:

Statistics: Bayes theorem


#### Prerequisite knowledge:

* Students should be able to set null and alternative hypotheses. 
* Students should be able to perform z-tests and t-tests using Python.
* Students should know how to use `scipy.stats` to generate normal random variables and how to draw samples from these instances.
